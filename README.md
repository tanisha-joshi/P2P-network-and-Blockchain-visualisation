```

## Features

- Sharded blockchain architecture
- Secure voter authentication
- Private voting using zero-knowledge proofs
- Cross-shard verification
- Scalable vote counting and aggregation

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Run the development server:
```bash
python3 main.py
```

## Architecture

The system consists of the following main components:

1. **Blockchain Layer**: Implements the sharded blockchain architecture
2. **Smart Contracts**: Handle voting logic and verification
3. **Voting System**: Manages voter registration and ballot submission
4. **Security Layer**: Implements cryptographic primitives and zero-knowledge proofs
5. **API Layer**: Provides REST endpoints for system interaction

## Security Features

- End-to-end encryption
- Zero-knowledge proofs for voter privacy
- Byzantine fault tolerance
- Cross-shard verification
- Immutable vote storage
